# Dashes vs Hyphens

## Hyphens vs Dashes (Source 1)

"Hyphens are basically used inside words to separate their parts from each other."

"The en dash is used to indicate an interval of some sort. This might mean a
range, as in “ages 10–15”, or a route, as in “Chicago–Memphis train”. Generally,
the en dash thus means “to”."

The em dash is a multiple-use punctuation symbol, but it basically separates
major parts of a statement, as opposite to the hyphen and the en dash, which
have more “local”, separative functions.

The uses of the em dash can be classified as follows:

- abrupt change—something unexpected follows after this punctuation character
- abrupt termination, to indicate that the flow of speech ends unnaturally
- parenthetic remark—like this—which might be seen as a special case of an 
abrupt change followed by a return (in a sense, an abrupt change too) to the 
main flow of thought
- in enumerations, as alternative to a list bullet.

## Hyphens

hyphen

A punctuation mark (-) used in some compound words, such as self-motivation,
seventy-five, and mother-in-law. A hyphen is also used to divide a word at the
end of a line of type. Hyphens may appear only between syllables. Thus com-pound
is properly hyphenated, but compo-und is not.

Punctuation: dashes ( – ) and other punctuation marks

Dashes are more common in informal writing. They can be used in similar ways to
commas or semi-colons. Both single and multiple dashes may be used:

Our teacher – who often gets cross when we’re late – wasn’t cross at all. No one
could believe it!

Just wanted to thank you for a lovely evening – we really enjoyed it.

Brackets have a similar function to dashes. They often add extra, non-essential
information:

Thriplow (pronounced ‘Triplow’) is a small village in the eastern part of
England.

We use brackets around dates and page numbers in academic writing:

Heaton (1978) gives a convincing explanation of how hurricanes are formed (pages
27–32).

We often use forward slashes in internet addresses and to indicate and/or in
academic references:

You can find the figures you need on www.bbc.co.uk/finance

Binks (1995/1997) has already researched this aspect of Roman history.

### Dashes (Source 2)

dash

A punctuation mark (—) used to indicate a sudden break in thought, to set off
parenthetical material, or to take the place of such expressions as that is and
namely: “He's running for reelection — if he lives until then”; “Very few people
in this class — three, to be exact — have completed their projects”; “She joined
the chorus for only one reason — she loves to sing.” In the last example, where
the parenthetical material comes at the end of the sentence rather than in the
middle, a colon could be used instead of the dash.
