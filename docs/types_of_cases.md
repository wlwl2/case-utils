# Types of Cases

I've taken all case type/cases information from the source:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case

I have summarized only the important details here with some modifications in
order for it to be understood better.

In some cases e.g. camel case/pascal case, the wikipedia article does not
mention about it being similar to all caps case in cases of "FFF", or "ID" for
example.

## Other Notes

### Start case vs proper case.

#### Proper Case:

https://support.office.com/en-us/article/PROPER-function-52A5A283-E8B2-49BE-8506-B2887B889F94

This article describes the formula syntax and usage of the PROPER  function in
Microsoft Excel.

Capitalizes the first letter in a text string and any other letters in text that
follow any character other than a letter. **Converts all other letters to
lowercase letters.**

#### Start Case:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case

I guess that start case does not do any conversions for all other letters.
Only affects the first letter of each word.

### Flat Case

### 1. All caps

All letters capitalized.

### 2. Small caps

If it is a capital letter or upper case, it becomes the same size as a normal
upper case letter, otherwise all lower case letters are changed to upper case 
letters each of which are about the size of a lower case x or slightly larger.

letters are slightly larger than the size of a lower case x.
